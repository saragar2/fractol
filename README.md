<br><h4>Fract-ol is one of the first graphic projects from the <a href="https://www.42madrid.com/">42 School</a> Common-Core. This is a fractal generator, all done in C code using MiniLibX, an own graphic library from the school. Includes Julia, Mandelbrot and Burning ship fractals. For the first one, you can edit the params so you get the fractal you want (they might be between -2 and 2, and they look better if they are between -1 and 1). You can navegate through the image, zoom, and change the iterations (so the color changes).<br>
<br>✨--- This project is done following 42 Norminette, so the code has the cleanest appearance possible.
<br>🎈--- Includes Julia, Mandelbrot and Burning ship fractals, and some bonus functions as moving with the arrows, zoom, and changing the colors.
<br>🎯--- Approved by peers with the final mark <b>120</b>.
<br>🕑--- Finished: 30th October 2024
<br>📜--- Includes comments so it is easier to understand the code
<br>⚠️--- This program only works correctly in Linux<br>

<h4><br>~~ Use the wheel from the mouse to zoom in or zoom out
<br>~~ Click with any part of the mouse to reset the fractal to the default config, as zoom, movement and colors.
<br>~~ Navigate through the fractal using the arrows in your keyboard.
<br>~~ Click on "+" and "-" in your keyboard to change the multiplyer of the iterations, which changes the final colors of the fractal.
<br>~~ Use any of these options to run the project (after doing Make):</h4>
<br><code>./fractol julia</code>
<br><code>./fractol mandelbrot</code>
<br><code>./fractol bs</code>
